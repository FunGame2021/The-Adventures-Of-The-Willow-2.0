# The Adventures Of The Willow 2.0 - Alpha Version

## [v0.0.1..] - 2024-01-28 - Alpha Version

   This is the alpha version release of The Adventures of the Willow 2.0.
  
  Please, if you are a Mac or Linux user, report if everything is working, it has not yet been tested on them. Also, if you are a Windows user, feel free to report any errors you may have.
  
  **Release Notes:**
  - Removed the restriction of adding tiles only inside the grid (this now serves as an isolation reference so the camera does not deviate from the level so as not to show empty areas).
  - Added sector loading when playing.
  - Improvements in creating and opening sectors in the editor.
  - Added doors and keys to load/enter different sectors or use different points in the same sector.
  
  - Note: It's an Alpha version, it still has a lot of bugs and is missing things, don't use the editor as something final, because you could lose the level save ("In principle nothing was detected or found about this, but use it only for testing and see if there are any problems").
